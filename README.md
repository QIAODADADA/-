Methodology: An Extended and Elaborated Approach

#### **1. Comprehensive Examination of Requirements**
To meet the high standards involved in industrial cleaning and inspection, an in-depth analysis was carried out to address the following needs:
- **Variety in Cleaning Ability**: The system should be able to remove different types of debris-metal shavings, dust, and oil residues-effectively without overloading the system or creating inconsistencies in cleaning.
- **Autonomous Navigation within Complex Environments:** It has to traverse narrow passage areas, extend alongside uneven surfaces, bypass obstacles, and operate flawlessly under strict mechanical clearances in industrial structures.
- **Integrated Inspection Functionality**: The robot must proactively monitor equipment for overheating, vibrations, and wear, ensuring defects are detected early to prevent downtime.
- **Data-Driven Operation**: The system must facilitate immediate feedback and operational assessment, incorporating cloud storage to allow for the monitoring and reporting of historical data.
- **Energy Efficiency and Sustainability**: The use of low-power components and energy-optimizing algorithms should enable the robot to be economical in terms of environmental standards.

#### 2. Modular Design Framework
The robot was first conceived in a modular framework for better scalability and adaptability:
- **Framework and Locomotion:

Alternative mobility tracked systems may find applications in scenarios featuring rugged terrain or heavy accumulation of debris.
- **Hygiene Regimens:
Various debris is handled by a variety of multi-stage cleaning mechanisms, including high-pressure water jets, heavy-duty vacuums, and surface-specific brushes.
- Adaptive suction control aims at energy efficiency while maintaining cleaning efficacy for variable densities and size of debris.
- **Evaluation Mechanisms:
- **4K HD cameras with 360Â° rotation** enable full visual inspection.
- Infrared sensors detect temperature anomalies indicating possible failures in machinery.
- **Vibration sensors** measure changes in operational stability, while metal detection sensors ensure no hazardous debris goes unnoticed.

#### 3. Red Infrared Radar for Improvement of Autonomous Cartography
Red infrared radar was added to extend the inspection and navigation capabilities of the robot. It allows:
- Real-time environmental cartography
Infrared radar maps 3D industrial environments with high accuracy by using SLAM-Simultaneous Localization and Mapping-technology.
- These maps dynamically change in view of changing environments to adapt the robot to new obstacles or a layout that has changed.
- **Heat Anomaly Detection**:
Infrared thermographic imaging works by sensing temperature differences in equipment and, through those, pinpoints hotspots that may indicate overloading or insufficient lubrication.
Threshold-based notifications are activated when temperature levels surpass designated safe operating thresholds.
- Proactive Maintenance Support:
It identifies reoccurring patterns through a combination of radar and heat information that predict equipment failure and allow operators to schedule maintenance before a breakdown can take place.

Infrared and LiDAR data, along with operational metrics, are continuously updated to the cloud-based servers.
Historical data is the foundation for developing heat maps, vibration trends, and cleaning efficiency metrics.
- **Instant watch and notifications:
- The operators can visualize, in real time, all inspection and cleaning activities through a web-based dashboard for remote supervisions.
Critical alerts are then broadcast to the stakeholders via email or mobile notifications for prompt response to any anomaly.
- **AI-Generated Insights:
Aggregated data are processed by machine learning algorithms to optimize navigation routes, improve cleaning efficiency, and enhance the precision of anomaly detection.

#### 5. Iterative Development and Prototyping
In order to make the system industrially acceptable, a carefully managed prototyping and development cycle was followed:
- **Mechanical Design:

Materials were chosen containing aluminum and high-strength polymers to be strong yet in a lightweight profile.
- **End Effector Customization:
For each individual function, different modular end effectors have been developed, including vacuum attachments, brushes, and infrared scanning devices.
Rapid prototyping techniques, including 3D printing, permitted quick iterations and testing.
- **Testing Framework:
- The prototypes underwent stress testing to gauge their endurance under continuous use in heavy industry.
Cleaning and inspection modules have been tested in different kinds of debris, equipment, and under various environmental circumstances.

#### **6. Testing and Check
A multiphase test protocol allowed for comprehensive verification:
- **Navigation and Mapping Accuracy:
Preciseness and responsiveness were assessed for SLAM and infrared mapping under both dynamic and static conditions in industrial scenarios.
- **Cleaning Efficiency:
The capability of the system in removing a wide range of debris in different sizes and densities, on flat and uneven surfaces, was evaluated.
- **Inspection Reliability**:
Accuracy of respective thermal-imaging, vibration detection and defect identification systems was assessed using various apparatuses either faulty or running.
- **Energy and Operational Efficiency:
In the first series, battery usage, cleaning velocity, and the duration of processing under continuous variable conditions were evaluated.

#### 7. Final Implementation and Maintenance
With that, the robot was successfully validated and ready for deployment:
- User Interface Development:
A user-friendly interface was designed that facilitates the operator's control, observation, and adjustment of the robot, using a minimum level of training.
- The incorporation of mobile and desktop platforms facilitated accessibility.
- **Operator Training Programs**:
- Long training on procedural operations was given, including system maintenance and troubleshooting.
These included video tutorials, user manuals, and interactive sessions.
Features like Predictive Maintenance:
IoT sensors monitor system health, predict component wear, and trigger alerts for timely replacements by operators.

#### **8. Metrics for Evaluation**
